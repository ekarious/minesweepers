# The Minesweeper Experiment

I Really like the Minesweeper game.
So much I coded it in typescript.

And I decided to code it in more language in the specific way of the language itself.

So here is the list of language I will perhaps make the game with:
- [x] Typescript
- [x] Svelte
- [ ] Lua - Love2D Game Engine ?
- [ ] Rust - Bevy Game Engine ?
- [ ] Python ?
- [ ] Go ?
