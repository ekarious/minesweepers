# The Minesweeper Experiment

I Really like the Minesweeper game.
So much I coded it in typescript.

And I decided to code it in more language in the specific way of the language itself.

SO here is the like of language I will make the game with:
- [x] Typescript
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Lua ?
